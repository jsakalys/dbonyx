dbonyx is a World of Warcraft auction house aggregator and analytics service. During development, the site is collecting data only for US based auction houses (120 at this time), and **processes between 3 and 4 million auctions per hour.** When fully deployed I plan to add other regions to the database which should double the number of auctions processed.

In addition to auction house statistics, I plan to add additional services, such as email price alerts for personalized watchlists, price trend graphs, tradeskill profitability calculators and more.

When the auction house services are fully functional I plan to extend the scope of the project to include a fully linked database of items, npcs, quests, etc. in the style of other major World of Warcraft databases, as well as other services and analytics not seen anywhere else.

All of this is made possible by extensive use of the World of Warcraft public APIs available at [https://dev.battle.net/](https://dev.battle.net/)
