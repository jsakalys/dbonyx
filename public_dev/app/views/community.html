<h2>Community Resources</h2>
<h3>Hey, we're so glad you're here!</h3>
Unfortunately, we don't have much in the way of community resources yet. BUT, here's a list of what we're working on, and what you can expect to see soon.
<ul>
<li><b>Forums:</b> What better way for users to communicate with each other? Ask questions, find answers, share war stories.</li>
<li><b>Comments</b> for items and other database entries: Let others know those details that are easy to miss.</li>
<li><b>User Profiles:</b> Show off your characters, show off your achievements, show off your battlepets.</li>
</ul>
We have so many more ideas that we want to work on too, but these are the focuses right now. Let us know what you think. Don't forget to leave feedback!
